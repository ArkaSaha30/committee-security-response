Thank you for your message.

It appears this report is neither a vulnerability report nor a security incident. Consider one of these public options instead:

- kubernetes-security-discuss@googlegroups.com
- open an issue: http://issues.k8s.io/new/choose
- #kubernetes-security slack channel: http://slack.k8s.io/

Thank you,

The Kubernetes Security Response Committee
